# bbrsmend.sh
- Install fish shell if you don't have it installed.
- Run bbrsmend.sh as ``` fish bbrsmend.sh secondssleep topicname ```
- Eg:- ``` fish bbrsmend.sh 900 mypgsm ``` :- When running for first time it sends the latest 5 programs and after that it checks if a new program is released every 15 minutes(900 seconds).
- Install the ntfy.sh app and enter mypgsm as the topic name or whatever you chose, no signup and all required.

- Same with sendnhour script also ``` fish sendnhour.sh secondssleep topicname ``` :- Sends the latest 5 programs every N hour(the number of seconds you gave).
